License: All the stuff by Gregor/Kurper is definitely MIT licensed. The stuff that Volte touched (I think mostly the CSS and a bit of the Javascript) has not been explicitly licensed, but he released it on Github so I assume he won't complain if you use it. If you plan to make money off this, you can probably get in contact with him.
